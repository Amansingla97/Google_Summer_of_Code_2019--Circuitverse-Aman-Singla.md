Google Summer of Code 2019

Organisation: [CircuitVerse](https://github.com/Amansingla97/CircuitVerse)

Project: [Interactive-book](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/Interactive-Book)

## Outcome of Gsoc19 project
The aim of this project is to create an online interactive guide for digital logic design. The primary goal which was to develop an open source book with quality content which teaches digital logic design is finally achieved. It enable's students to learn digital design by interacting with circuits,truth table and other interactive elements as they proceed through the book.The professors and students all over the world can read and contribute to the same.

## Code Contribution

### A total of 140+ commits were made by me

- [Issue Raised](https://github.com/CircuitVerse/Interactive-Book/issues/created_by/Amansingla97).

## Overview
The Interactive book have two components in it. 
1. Content
2. Interactions

### Content
It include's quality content which would be gathered from various books (primarily from ‘​Digital Design​’ by ​Morris Mano as its copyright has expired and is in public domain) and online material. Basic notes have already been prepared to reference the aforementioned book and are attached in the table below.

### Interactions
There would be two types of Interactions.

1. **Circuit Interactions-** This include designing optimal circuits which would help to clearly understand the logic. The student would be able to clearly detect the variation of output with the change in input via these circuits. With each Interaction module, there would be a set of instructions that would guide the user to see the desired changes.
2. **Module Specific Interactions-** This include interaction which are designed for individual module like kmap simulator , truth table generatoretc.
